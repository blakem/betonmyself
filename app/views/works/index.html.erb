<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>

You will use the BetOnMyself site to track promises to yourself.  Bets on
yourself, if you will.  For instance, you place a $20 bet that you will
make an appointment with your tax advisor by March 15th.  That's it.  All
of a sudden, calling your tax advisor will turn from a burdensome chore,
into a fun little game.  Once you've scheduled your appointment, you win
your bet and get paid $20 out of your account.  Yay!

</p><p>

After setting up your account, you'll have access to the tools you need for
keeping track of your promises.  You can see what this looks like on the
<%= link_to "demo", {:controller => "demo"} %> page.

</p><p>
We'll even give you 
<b><%= sigil_money(BomConstant::INITIAL_LOAN_AMOUNT, :round) %></b> 
to start with.  You won't be able to cash this money out, but if you 
<%= link_to "sign up", {:controller => "users", :action => "new"} %> now, 
you'll be able to place 
<b><%= sigil_money(BomConstant::INITIAL_LOAN_AMOUNT, :round) %></b>
worth of free bets to get a feel for how the site works.... And start
getting your stuff done!
</p><p>

<%= link_to "Sign me up!", {:controller => "users", :action => "new"}, :class => "red_link"%>
