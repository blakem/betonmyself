<h2>My story</h2>

<p>

Let's try a little thought experiment. Think of all the things on your ToDo
list.  Things you should get done, tasks you need to get done, and
aspirations you want to achieve. If you really think hard about it, the
list gets pretty long. Now, rewind a week.  What would that list look like
then?  Now a month. How about a year?  What you'll find is a lot of change
at the top of your list.  What about the bottom of that list?  For me, it
hardly changed at all! Week after week, month after month.  The bottom half
of my ToDo list stayed frozen in time.  Once something fell down there, it
never ever got done... But it stayed on the list.

</p><p>

Now let's look at that piece of the list.  Mine included sorting a box full
of junk that's been sitting in a corner for over a year.  It also included
"Learn to salsa dance" Hmmm... now that's messed up, my dream of
learning the salsa is mentally filed right next to a messy box that makes
me cringe every time I think about it. That doesn't seem right, at all!

</p><p>

The messy box is an example of <b><em>deadweight</em></b>.  It's something
I need to get done at somepoint, just never today.  I feel tense whenever I
think about it, so I choose to ignore it.  But, and this is key, there is
some part of me that is tied up in remembering that I need to clean out
that box someday.

Now sitting right in the same category is my desire to learn the salsa.
Guess what, the tension I feel about the box leaks right over into the
dancing slot.  In some sense, the whole things-to-do-someday pile gets
sullied by my tension over that messy box.  And so the whole thing gets
pushed off again and again.

</p><p>

Since a piece of me is tied up thinking about that messy box, I'm unable to
give my all to anything else in my life.  It's not a big piece, but it
takes a big toll.  Think about moving a couch up some stairs.  Like life,
it presents some big challenges, but I know I can do it.  Now think about
what it would be like to try to move that couch while holding a penny.  A
little piece of you is distracted by that penny and makes the task of
moving the couch *immensely* harder, if not impossible.

</p><p>

So, here is what I did.  I made a new-years resolution to clean up that
messy box.  Guess what my new years resolution was the next year. Yep,
still there, clean out that messy box.  There was no accountability, so
there was no action.  Only a tension, and a notion that I would do it
sometime later.  Well, that changed this year...

This year I made no resolutions.  Instead, I gave my buddy $50, and asked
him to hold onto it until I got my messy box cleaned up.  I gave myself a
deadline, my birthday six weeks away.  If I didn't have my box cleaned up
by then, I didn't get my money back.

</p><p>

And guess what happened.  All of a sudden, I was excited about that box.
Yeah!  Thinking about that box made me happy.  I *knew* that box would be
cleaned and out of my life in six weeks.  I didn't know how or when I was
going to do it, but I had a certainty that it would finally get done.  That
night I gleefully started rummaging through that box.  Dumping stuff all
over the floor, throwing stuff out, reveling in the whole experience.  Now
that's powerful.  The deadweight that had been holding me back, was finally
getting done. And I was haing *fun* doing it!

</p><p>

This is what I want to share with you.  That transformational experience of
converting deadweight in your life into fun accomplishments.  Uncovering
the dreams that lie right next to them.  Giving you the space and intention
to reach higher and dream bigger.  Clear out the deadweight, so you can
focus on the dreams that make life worth living.
